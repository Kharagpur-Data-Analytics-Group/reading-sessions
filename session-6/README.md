**KDAG**: We have made a series on "Bagging and Boosting", we cover the mathematical details, direct you to proper resources if you want to delve deeper.  
**Students**: (After watching) Each video is short, crisp and to the point, man! (pause) Well ...  
**KDAG**: Well, in the sense?  
**Students**: Well, you have a video series we do not need now, but we do deserve to watch once in this lifetime. Kudos!  

KDAG invites you all to devote your binge-watching skills for a 10-video series on "Bagging and Boosting". Each video is "extremely" short and to the point. Once you finish the first video, in no time you will be saying goodbye to us in the 10th video. Hope you enjoy the series!
