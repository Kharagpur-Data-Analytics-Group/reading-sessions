**Students**: Thinking Fast and Slow! How can someone think fast and slow at the same time?   
**KDAG**: Ohh wait, why are you worried with this notion when we are there to explain   
**Students**: Sure, please explain what this exactly is.   
**KDAG**: Yeah, sure. Have patience and go through the video, you will get a good idea.

KDAG brings to you a wonderful paper published in CVPR 2021 i.e., "Thinking Fast and Slow: Efficient Text-to-Visual Retrieval with Transformers (https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16553)". It is a short and to-the-point video (as we always do). Have a look at it, feel free to give us feedback!
