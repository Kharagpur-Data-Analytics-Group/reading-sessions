**Students**: Accelerate Training? Are you talking about some race?   
**KDAG**: Everything is a race indeed in this world. </br>
**Students**: Can you please elaborate?   
**KDAG**: Yeah, sure. Computer becomes intelligent faster than before.  

KDAG brings to you a paper "Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift (https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167)". It is a short and to-the-point video (as we always do). Have a look at it, feel free to give us feedback!
