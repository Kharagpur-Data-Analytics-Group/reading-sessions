**Students**: We want a lady speaker for the next session.  
**KDAG**: Wow, we did not see this coming.  
**Students**: You, two guys, have been speaking for the last two months. We have an entire reader community...

KDAG invites you all to devote your attention to "Neural Machine Translation with Attention Mechanism". We will try to keep it short, starting sharp at 6.05 (usual 5-minute delay) in the evening, we wish to wrap up the presentation by 6.45 pm. A short form would be released at the end to enter your choice of Paper in the field of AI that you wish us to take up for the next sessions. If we can convert it to a presentation, we are gonna present it (in due time)!
