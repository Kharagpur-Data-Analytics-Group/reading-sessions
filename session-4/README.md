**KDAG**: In a world, oops campus, where students are experiencing deja vu, where emotional apocalypse looms over, a time window of three weeks arrives, where we are expected to shine and rise through the hours of darkness by gathering our remaining energy and exciting ourselves.
**Students**: Aren't you a bit darker than usual?
**KDAG**: No matter how devastated we are, no matter how breath-taking (pun intended) our adventure to date has been ...
**Students**: Stop, you are making me feel too much worried ...
KDAG invites you all to a session on "Gather-Excite: Exploiting Feature Context in Convolutional Neural Networks" [https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12348]. We promise to keep it short, starting sharp at 6.05 (usual 5-minute delay) in the evening, we wish to wrap up the presentation by 6.35 pm. A short form would be released at the end to enter your choice of Paper in the field of AI that you wish us to take up for the next sessions. If we can convert it to a presentation, we are gonna present it (in due time)!
