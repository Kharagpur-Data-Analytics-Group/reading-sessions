This "Valentine's Day", be ready for a convolutional evening on artistic style, as KDAG presents its first-ever reading session on ["A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576). We promise to keep it short, starting sharp at 6.05 (usual 5-minute delay) in the evening, we wish to wrap up the presentation by 6.35 pm. 
A short form would be released at the end to enter your choice of Paper in the field of AI that you wish us to take up for the next sessions. If we can convert it to a presentation, we are gonna present it (in due time)!
