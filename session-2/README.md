**KDAG**: This Spring Break, be ready to participate in an evening of "Dank Learning" with Deep Learning ...     
**KGP community**: Wait what? You said "Memes"? Yo man, I'm in.     
**KDAG**: That easy? I thought I had to explain a lot! Ah! Relief.    

Join us at the AI reading session by KDAG on [Dank Learning: Generating Memes Using Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04510). We promise to keep it short, starting sharp at 6.05 (usual 5-minute delay) in the evening, we wish to wrap up the presentation by 6.35 pm.
A short form would be released at the end to enter your choice of Paper in the field of AI that you wish us to take up for the next sessions. If we can convert it to a presentation, we are gonna present it (in due time)
