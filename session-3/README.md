This month past Valentine's Day, KDAG invites you all to an R-Rated session on something which translates to "Ridiculous Technical (Jargon) Language for Stupid Person"[https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02783]. We promise to keep it short, starting sharp at 6.05 (usual 5-minute delay) in the evening, we wish to wrap up the presentation by 6.35 pm (for sure xD). A short form would be released at the end to enter your choice of Paper in the field of AI that you wish us to take up for the next sessions. If we can convert it to a presentation, we are gonna present it (in due time)
